This is a little advanced ToDo List using my basic knowledge of css, html, java-script, nodejs, expressjs and ejs. I added the functionality of data base here too now. I have used the mongoDB for the purpose of the data base. There is a module that is named mongoose that is used to handle all the basics of the data base and this is helpful in the readability and the simplicity of the code.
This is just for the beginners and hence I have added all the comments needed for the better understanding of the project.
